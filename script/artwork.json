The challenge was to create a metaphor (driven by the current school lessons), we picked one out of a hat and started creating! Was a fun piece to make while my kids were home on spring break! As we created we discuss literal meanings and figurative meanings and this piece began to form. I finished it in chalk pastels. I enjoyed this piece because it reminds me of the time and laughs with my daughter.",
