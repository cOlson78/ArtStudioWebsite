    <h1>Client critique (copied and pasted verbatim):</h1>
    <p>I think youe web design looks great. The tabs a fantastic and very user friendly, especially for someone like me who is not into computers and needs help navigating! I showed it to some friends who also thought it would be easy to use from a consumer perspective as well. </p> 
    <p>I thought my pieces were laid out nicely in a good quality and was impressed by the simplicity while offering the information that is needed! </p>
