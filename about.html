        <h1>About Laura Stigen</h1>
        <p class="text">My name is Laura Stigen. I live in North Carolina with my wife and 4 kids.  
            I am a former Special Education teacher who found herself staying home when COVID hit.  
            I studied Art at Beloit College and now spend my days creating art and gardens with my family. 
            I create my work out of a little red studio on 2.5 acres of land. 
            We garden, have ducks and bunnies and many trees to enjoy working both inside and out.  
            I work in abstract mediums, follow my feelings and am inspired by the nature and wonderful chaos of family life!</p>

        <p class="text">Prior to working in art and education I had an adventurous life of travel. 
            I lived in the woods of Georgia for year working with young people who were discovering how to navigate their environments.  
            I lived in Hungary for a couple of years playing soccer and teaching English.  
            There I was able to travel and see so many things that have inspired me along the way.  
            All the way, I had a sketch book and was able to continue panting and creating.</p>
